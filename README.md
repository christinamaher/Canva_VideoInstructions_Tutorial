# Canva Video Instructions Tutorial

Tutorial for using [Canva](https://www.canva.com/education/) to create video instructions for tasks. This is a helpful tool for gamifying your tasks - the importance of task gamification for research is highlighted by [Long et al., 2023](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-00065-6)! 

The **first step** is to create a free account by visiting [Canva](https://www.canva.com/education/). There is a 14-day free trial for Canva Pro which grants access to all site features. However, Canva Pro is *not* absolutely necessary for creating video instructions.

**Next,** create a blank video by clicking on 'Video' from the available templates.

Add and rearrange scenes by pressing the plus sign button:

Add background images or avatars by navigating to the Elements tab and searching for your desired features:

Add sound effects and background music by navigating to the Audio tab and searching for your desired audio:

To add a voice recording of your instructions, you will need to record the audio externally. [Online Voice Recorder](https://online-voice-recorder.com/) is an easy and free site for recording mp3 files on your local device.

Once you've recorded your instructions, import the mp3 files to Canva using the Uploads > Audio tab. You can also import your own images and/or video clips within the Uploads tab:

Drag and drop your audio files beneath the corresponding scene(s):

Once you are finished with your video, download it locally as an mp4 file by navigating to Share > Download.

Note, it is important to consider principles of [Universal Design](https://www.washington.edu/doit/universal-design-process-principles-and-applications) (i.e., captioning your video or ensuring that a transcript is made available to participants) when creating task instructions so ensure accessibility.
